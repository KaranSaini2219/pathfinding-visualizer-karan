# Pathfinding Visualizer

This is a simple web application built to help visualize how Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm works. It allows users to interactively place walls and see the algorithm find the shortest path between a start and end node.

## About Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two points in a graph. It works by exploring all possible paths and always choosing the shortest available option at each step. This visualizer shows the step-by-step process of how the algorithm works on a grid.
